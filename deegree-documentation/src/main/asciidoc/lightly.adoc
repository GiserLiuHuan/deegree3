== Getting started

In the previous chapter, you learned how to install and start deegree
webservices. In this chapter, we will introduce the deegree webservices
administration console and learn how to use it to perform basic tasks such as
downloading and activating example configurations. In deegree
terminology, a complete configuration for a deegree instance is called
"deegree workspace".

The following chapters describe the structure and the aspects of the
deegree workspace in detail. For the remainder of this chapter, just
think of a deegree workspace as a directory of configuration files that
contains a complete configuration for a deegree webservice instance. You
may have multiple deegree workspaces on your machine, but only a single
workspace can be active.

=== Accessing the deegree webservices administration console

The console is a web-based administration interface for
configuring your deegree webservices installation. If deegree
webservices are running on your machine, you can usually access the administration
console from your browser via http://localhost:8080/deegree-webservices

.deegree webservices administration console
image::console_start.png[deegree webservices administration console,scaledwidth=50.0%]

TIP: You can access the administration console from other machines on your network
by exchanging _localhost_ with the name or IP address of the machine
that runs deegree webservices.

For the remainder of the chapter, only the *general* section is
relevant. The menu items in this section:

* *workspaces*: Download and activate example configurations
* *proxy*: Configure network proxy settings
* *password*: Set a password for accessing the administration console
* *module info*: Display loaded deegree modules
* *send requests*: Send raw OGC web service requests
* *see layers*: Display WMS layers

[[anchor-downloading-workspaces]]
==== Downloading and activating example workspaces

Click the *workspaces* link on the left:

.Workspaces view
image::console_workspaces.png[Workspaces view,scaledwidth=50.0%]

The bottom of the workspaces view lists example workspaces provided by
the deegree project. You should see the following items:

* *deegree-workspace-utah*: <<anchor-workspace-utah>>
* *deegree-workspace-csw*: <<anchor-workspace-csw>>
* *deegree-workspace-wps*: <<anchor-workspace-wps>>

TIP: If the machine running deegree webservices uses a proxy to access the
internet, and you don't see any available example configurations, you
will probably have to configure the proxy settings. Ask your network
administrator for details and use the *proxy* link to setup deegree's
proxy settings.

If you click *Import*, the corresponding example workspace will be
fetched from the artifact repository of the deegree project and
extracted in your deegree workspaces folder. Depending on the workspace
and your internet connection, this may take a while (the Utah workspace
is the largest one and about 70 MB in size).

After downloading has completed, the new workspace will be listed in
section "Available workspaces":

.Downloaded, but inactive workspace
image::console_workspace_imported.png[Downloaded, but inactive workspace,scaledwidth=50.0%]

You can now activate the downloaded workspace by clicking *Start*.
Again, this may take a bit, as it may require some initialization. The
workspace will be removed from the list of inactive workspaces and
displayed next to "Active workspace:" (below the deegree logo). Your
deegree instance is now running the configuration that is contained in
the downloaded workspace.

[[anchor-workspace-utah]]
=== Example workspace 1: Utah Webmapping Services

The Utah example workspace contains a web mapping setup based on data
from the state of Utah. It contains a WMS configuration (1.3.0 and
1.1.1) with some raster and vector layers and some nice render styles.
Raster data is read from GeoTIFF files, vector data is backed by
shapefiles. Additionally, a WFS (2.0.0, 1.1.0 and 1.0.0) is configured
that allows to access the raw vector data in GML format.

////
After downloading and activating the "deegree-workspace-utah" workspace,
you can click on the *see layers* link, which opens a simple map client
that displays a base map (not rendered by deegree, but loaded from the
OpenStreetMap servers).

.Map client showing base map
image::console_workspace_utah1.png[Map client showing base map,scaledwidth=50.0%]

Click the *+* on the right to see a list of available layers. Tick the
ones you want to see. They will be rendered by your deegree webservices
instance.

.Selecting WMS layers to be displayed
image::console_workspace_utah2.png[Selecting WMS layers to be displayed,scaledwidth=50.0%]

TIP: The map client is based on https://openlayers.org/[OpenLayers]. Drag the
map by holding the mouse button and moving your mouse. Zoom using the
controls on the left or with the mouse wheel. Alternatively, you can
open a zoom rectangle by holding the SHIFT key and clicking the mouse
button in the map area.

.Exploring Utah layers
image::console_workspace_utah3.png[Exploring Utah layers,scaledwidth=50.0%]

In order to send requests against the WFS, you may use the *send
requests* link in the administration console (you may need to go back in your
browser first). A simple interface for sending XML requests will open
up. This interface is meant for accessing OGC web services on the
protocol level and contains some reasonable example requests.

.Sending example requests
image::console_workspace_utah4.png[Sending example requests,scaledwidth=50.0%]

Select one of the example requests from the third drop-down menu and
click *Send*. The server response will be displayed in the lower
section.

.Sending example requests
image::console_workspace_utah5.png[Sending example requests,scaledwidth=50.0%]

TIP: WFS request types and their format are specified in the
https://www.ogc.org/standard/wfs/[OGC Web Feature Service
specification].

TIP: Instead of using the built-in layer preview or the generic OGC client,
you may use any compliant OGC client for accessing the WMS and WFS.
Successfully tested desktop clients include QGIS (install WFS
plugin for accessing WFS), uDig and OpenJUMP. The
service address to enter in your client is:
http://localhost:8080/deegree-webservices/services.

[[anchor-workspace-csw]]
=== Example workspace 2: An ISO Catalogue Service setup

This workspace contains a catalogue service (CSW) setup that complies to
the ISO Application Profile. After downloading and starting it, you will
have to setup tables in a PostGIS database first. You will need to have
an empty and spatially-enabled PostGIS database handy that can be
accessed from the machine that runs deegree webservices.

TIP: Instead of PostGIS, you can also use the workspace with an Oracle
Spatial or a Microsoft SQL Server database. In order to enable support
for these databases, see <<anchor-db-libraries>>.

After downloading and starting the workspace, some errors will be
indicated (red exclamation marks):

.Initial startup of deegree-workspace-csw
image::console_workspace_csw1.png[Initial startup of deegree-workspace-csw,scaledwidth=50.0%]

Don't worry, this is just because we're missing the correct connection
information to connect to our database. We're going to fix that right
away. Click *connections -> databases*:

.JDBC connection view
image::console_workspace_csw2.png[JDBC connection view,scaledwidth=50.0%]

Click *Edit*:

.Editing the JDBC resource configuration file
image::console_workspace_csw3.png[Editing the JDBC resource configuration file,scaledwidth=50.0%]

Make sure to enter the correct connection parameters and click *Save*.
You should now have a working connection to your database, and the
exclamation mark for *conn1* should disappear. Click *Reload* to force a
full reinitialization of the workspace:

.Saving the configuration and reinitializing the workspace
image::console_workspace_csw4.png[Saving the configuration and reinitializing the workspace,scaledwidth=50.0%]

The indicated problems are gone now, but we still need to create the
required database tables. Change to the metadata store view (*data
stores -> metadata*) and click *Setup tables*:

.Metadata store view
image::console_workspace_csw5.png[Metadata store view,scaledwidth=50.0%]

In the next view, click *Execute*:

.Creating tables for storing ISO metadata records
image::console_workspace_csw6.png[Creating tables for storing ISO metadata records,scaledwidth=50.0%]

.After table creation
image::console_workspace_csw7.png[After table creation,scaledwidth=50.0%]

If all went well, you should now have a working, but empty CSW setup.
You can connect to the CSW with compliant clients and import data.

////
or use the *send requests* link to send raw CSW requests to the service. The workspace
comes with some suitable example requests. Use the third drop-down menu
to select an example request. Entry *complex_insert.xml* can be used to
insert some ISO example records using a CSW transaction request:

.Choosing example requests
image::console_workspace_csw8.png[Choosing example requests,scaledwidth=50.0%]

Click *Send*. After successful insertion, some records have been
inserted into the CSW (respectively the database). You may want to
explore other example requests as well, e.g. for retrieving records:

.Other example CSW requests

[[anchor-workspace-wps]]
=== Example workspace 3: Web Processing Service demo

This workspace contains a WPS setup with simple example processes and
example requests. It's a good starting point for learning the WPS
protocol and the development of WPS processes. After downloading and
starting it, click *send requests* in order to find example requests
that can be sent to the WPS. Use the third drop-down menu to select an
example request:

.Choosing a WPS example request
image::console_workspace_wps1.png[Choosing a WPS example request,scaledwidth=50.0%]

Click *Send* to fire it against the WPS:

.Sending an example request against the WPS
image::console_workspace_wps2.png[Sending an example request against the WPS,scaledwidth=50.0%]

The response of the WPS will be displayed in the lower section:

.WPS response is displayed
image::console_workspace_wps3.png[WPS response is displayed,scaledwidth=50.0%]

Besides the geometry example processes, the parameter example process
and example requests may be interesting to developers who want to learn
development of WPS processes with deegree webservices:

.Example requests for the parameter demo process
image::console_workspace_wps4.png[Example requests for the parameter demo process,scaledwidth=50.0%]

The process has four input parameters (literal, bounding box, xml and
binary) that are simply piped to four corresponding output parameters.
There's practically no process logic, but the included example requests
demonstrate many of the possibilities of the WPS protocol:

* Input parameter passing variants (inline vs. by reference)
* Output parameter handling (inline vs. by reference)
* Response variants (ResponseDocument vs. RawData)
* Storing of response documents
* Asynchronous execution

.Example requests for the ParameterDemo process
image::console_workspace_wps5.png[Example requests for the ParameterDemo process,scaledwidth=50.0%]

TIP: WPS request types and their format are specified in the
https://www.ogc.org/standard/wps/[OGC Web Processing Service
specification].

TIP: In order to add your own processes, see <<anchor-configuration-wps>> and
<<anchor-configuration-processproviders>>.
